# How Does It work (HDIW)

How Does It Work is a CLI program which allows you to view what makes a certain program / game run. HDIW makes it super simple to find out what certain programs use, but just making you input the directory!

## Usage

To use HDIW, simply run it with a directory parameter, for example: `python3 hdiw "C:\Users\user\Downloads"` would scan the entire Downloads directory, but you probably don't want to do that.

Below is an example of an output generated by HDIW

The most common way of using HDIW is on games, you just need to copy the game's directory and then run HDIW like shown above!

## Installation

To install HDIW you can simply just download the zip from github, and then unzip it. To test if it works you can type run the command `python3 hdiw.py -h`. If you get a help message, you have succesfully installed HDIW!

## Contributing

There are many things that HDIW needs help with, whether it's adding new Game Engines / Frameworks, or optimizations, bugfixes, or quality of life features. We're always open to accepting pull requests!

### Adding New Technologies

To add a new technology, open the `main.json` file. You will see `file-extension`, `name-contains`, and `name-colors`. Let's say you want to make files ending with .py add Python as a result, you would add the following to `file-extension`:

```json
".py": {
	"name": "Python",
	"chance": 100,
	"category": "Programming Languages"
}
```

`name`: The name of the technology
`chance`: How certain you are that the directory contains this technology.
`category`: The category of thetechnology

You can also use `name-contains` the same way, except make the key of the dictionary the text you want to look for.

Next, you want to set a color for your technology. Under `name-colors` add a new line. For this example it will be `"python": "YELLOW"`.

The colors you can currently use are

```
BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET
LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX
```
