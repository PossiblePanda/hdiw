# How Does It work (HDIW)

How Does It Work is a CLI program which allows you to view what makes a certain program / game run. HDIW makes it super simple to find out what certain programs use, but just making you input the directory!

## Usage

To use HDIW, simply run it with a directory parameter, for example: `python3 hdiw "C:\Users\user\Downloads"` would scan the entire Downloads directory, but you probably don't want to do that.

Below is an example of an output generated by HDIW

The most common way of using HDIW is on games, you just need to copy the game's directory and then run HDIW like shown above!

## Installation

To install HDIW you can simply just download the zip from github, and then unzip it. To test if it works you can type run the command `python3 hdiw.py -h`. If you get a help message, you have succesfully installed HDIW!
